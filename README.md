# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Application of the data analysis using Excel tools to provide strongh elements for better decisions in a short time. The resolutions will be sustained through detailed visual data, relations between the diferent sceneria and an overview inside each specific requirement.
### Purpose
Achieve the requirements of Louise in behalf to take decisions based on the data analysis. The project is designed to match the different requests bringing an analysis from the results showed inside. We bring solutions as tables and charts to see how much the campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. In resume we need to provide as much as we can the data collected by years of campaigns in a more visual and statistical way to help Louis understand better the needs and the achievements.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We noticed that the campaigns have more outcomes when they are launched in summer.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
__It is better to launch a campaign in summer according to achieve more outcomes.__
It seems to be a trend that almost 50% of the campaigns failed, no matter the month of the year. The summer have more campaigns than the rest of the year which means that we are going to have more successful, however the percentage of the rest of the year is telling us that the trend is almost the same all over the year. So the only strongh conclusion is that in May and June we have a more succesful over failed campaigns than the rest of the year, but also that we have a trend which tell us that we have 50/50 chance of a succesfull or failed campaing no matter the month.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
__The outcomes based on goals have other overwiew. When we start to involve forecast or goals we are putting a limit on the achivements.__ We can notice that the lowest the goal is, we success on the campaign.The highest the goal is, the campaign seems to fail. We can take that conclusion with the left half of the chart wich is more representative. The right half shows less than 5 campaigns per amount of goal, so we don't know exactly what happend on those campaigns.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The main limitations is the campaings that are not representative and may impact on the results and the analysis. We have some campaigns that failed or succes which are not following the trends or has specific impacts.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
